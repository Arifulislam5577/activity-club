    "answer": "The useEffect Hook allows us to perform side effects in our components. Some examples of side effects are: directly updating the DOM, and timers.if we need to run the side effect every time a combination of state and props change. This use case may occur when our side effect depends on the state and props values. In this case, we need to pass both the state and props variables as dependencies."
